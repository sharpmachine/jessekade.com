				<h1>Branding</h1>
				<p class="lead">We believe in building purpose-driven brands. Your price and product will change as you grow, but your purpose should never change.</p>
				<p class="lead">We've simplified the branding process to make it easier for our clients' to understand, appreciate and follow along, while still delivering maximum impact. We can design out the visual and tonal manifestation of that strategy, such as the logo, typefaces, icons and tone-of-voice, as well as a style guide to help your team manage your brand well.</p>

				<p class="lead">Besides that, it also needs to meet your business goals.  We like to ask, "If your website was an employee, what would you want it to do for you?".  The answer to that question will give us a good idea of where to start.</p>
