				<p class="text-center lead libre">BJM is a non-profit organization whose influence has been felt all around the world.  They are based in Redding, CA.</p>
				<p class="text-center lead libre">I worked closely with a team of UI designers and BJM to develop an elegant, classy and established mood.  Our inspiration were things like high-end fountain pens and leather hand-stitched car seats.</p>
