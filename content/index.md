				<p>I've always been into computers. When I was very young my mom had a Macintosh at work. I'd make her bring it home on the weekends so I could play with it. As I got older I took every computer class at school that I could. This is where I learned how to make websites.</p>
				<p>A few years ago I started Sharp Machine Media – a branding, strategy and design studio. We've done some amazing projects and built an amazing team. Through it all I've learned so much and grew greatly, not only as a UXer and coder, but also as a leader.</p>
				<p>Recently my wife and I decided to make a move to Orange County, CA to purse more opportunities in our respective fields. I'd like to join a team of creatives that value excellence, innovation and personal growth.</p>
				<p><small>note: I'm currently based in Redding, Ca but am moving to Orange County in a few months.</small></p>
